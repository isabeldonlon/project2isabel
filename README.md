# PROJECT 2
###I honestly struggled with this project and was unable to generate numbers of symbols to my checkboxes. 
### I'm also not sure why the error shows at the top of the page before a number is chosen, because it doesn't appear locally,
### and I tried to remove error reporting with no luck. I did use error reporting in making this though.
###Ultimately I hope that I can still get a passing grade for this assignment despite its shortocmings.
